Project 3 for intro to AI
#NOTE that when using the visual agent, when we drag the speed towards going very fast sometimes the program does not act i na desired manner. 

Please use our code in full, as a signifigant amount of functions were modified in order to make this work. Particularly because of the extra files, so just import the project to get this to run.



We added a couple different files and classes
these include Resource, Townhall, and Peasant for the planner package
and Build_Peasant, Deposit, Harvest, Harvest_Gold, Harvest_Wood, Move_To_Resourse, and Move_To_Townhall in the action package
