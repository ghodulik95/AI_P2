Project 3 for intro to AI

NOTE that when using the visual agent, when we drag the speed towards going very fast sometimes the program does not act i na desired manner. 

Please use our code in full, as a signifigant amount of functions were modified in order to make this work. Particularly because of the extra files, so just import the project to get this to run.

use the data/FileName.xml tag in the arguments
we use main2 as the class to run the code.

We added a couple different files and classes
these include Resource, Townhall, and Peasant for the planner package
and Build_Peasant, Deposit, Harvest, Harvest_Gold, Harvest_Wood, Move_To_Resourse, and Move_To_Townhall in the action package
we also modified strips_action
